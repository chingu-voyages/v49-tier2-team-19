Your project's `readme` is as important to success as your code. For 
this reason you should put as much care into its creation and maintenance
as you would any other component of the application.

If you are unsure of what should go into the `readme` let this article,
written by an experienced Chingu, be your starting point - 
[Keys to a well written README](https://tinyurl.com/yk3wubft).

And before we go there's "one more thing"! Once you decide what to include
in your `readme` feel free to replace the text we've provided here.

# How to Setup your Developer Environment (edits welcome!)

Open your terminal and navigate to your local copy of the git repository. If you don't have the git repository cloned yet, please enter the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v49-tier2-team-19.git`

Once the folder is cloned, follow the rest of the instructions below.

- Copy the `.env.template` file to a new file that's just named `.env` in the `colorpicker` folder. 

- Add the `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=123` to `colorpicker/.env` (ask teammates for the API key)

Navigate to the colorpicker folder.
```
cd colorpicker
```

Install the code library requirements.
```
yarn
```

Run the app!
```
yarn run dev
```

You should now see a message in your terminal like
```
  VITE v5.2.11  ready in 988 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

## Remaining questions for team to discuss in standup
1. Do we want to use yarn or npm for package / library management? I'm not sure why we have both types of package manager files in our repository.
