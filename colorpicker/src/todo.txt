Figure out env and gitignore
figure out how to hide key and commit? maybe? i never understood
what was wrong with my new branch (key visible in commits but not in final
files)

Am i diverging too much from what Hector is doing?
Got super confused trying to upload to a new branch
Still not sure how to do a pull request from vs code

steps:
add text box for hex code and submit button. (move submit button?)
add text box for request for recommendation.
get open ai key
add open ai: need openaiService.js (learn more about completions)
send response to console (make responses just a list of hex codes)
next: capture response, original prompt, and original hexcode

keep getting this error:
